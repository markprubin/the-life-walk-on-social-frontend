      <h2>About The Founder</h2>
      <p>
        Mark Rubin is an independent personal trainer in Phoenix and Scottsdale, where he strives to work with any
        client of any level to help them put the pieces together towards fulfilling their potential. â€‹ Mark was a
        collegiate swimmer at the University of the Incarnate Word, where he also obtained his Bachelor of Science in
        Biology. After deciding that dental school was not what he wanted to do, he left two months into the first
        semester to pursue a career as a coach. He received his Master of Science in Exercise and Wellness at Arizona
        State University.

        After an extensive career in sports performance and strength and conditioning, working with soccer clubs like
        Norwich City FC, San Antonio FC, as well as working with youth athletes in the middle school, high school, and
        collegiate level, he explored some hobbies outside of work, and came across coding.

      <p>
        What became a love for problem solving and logic turned into a potential career transition... again! After
        completing the Actualize Coding Bootcamp, he is continuing practicing coding and looking to break into the tech
        world. He vowed to have a positive effect on this world if he transitioned careers, and that is what he aims to
        do.
